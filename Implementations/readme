Project: Machine learning techniques for radar target recognition
Implementation files:
- Download data: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VhHrsd4bsBKlOPu6mcLdzSeEooLo43ul?usp=sharing and put it the Implementations folder, Change the root folder in the script to run the code
- AlexNet, GoogleNet (Matlab):
    + 5 Trained networks, 1 trained with full dataset trajectories, 4 trained with one trajectory
- Lenet, CustomNet (Pytorch):
    + 5 Trained networks, same as AlexNet and GoogleNet
- A script to calculate F1 score to compare the networks performance (included in the network script)
